##### Revision: V.2

-------
The Chronocar's flash frequency of LEDs(the headlights) and piezo are determined by the number of seconds it travels.
Users are able to input the number of seconds (1-99) using the increase and decrease buttons and it will be displayed
on the 4-digit 7-segment display. Then, the user can press the start button and the car will travel for x number of seconds. 
It utilizes an Arduino Uno as the microcontroller and a pully system to connect the axels to the motor. 

Use the website https://cloud.arduino.cc to inject the code into an arduino to run.

##### Future Goals:
  - Condense the code for the display using methods (See Water Bottle Electrical Alarm project for example)
  - Further optimize the aesthetics of the wiring on the 3D printed body
  - Improve the fit of the 3D model
